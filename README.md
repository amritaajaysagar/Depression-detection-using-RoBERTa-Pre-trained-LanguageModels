This notebook demonstrates how to use the RoBERTa model to classify social media texts into three categories: "Not depressed," "Moderately depressed," and "Severely depressed." 
We preprocess the data, define the RoBERTa model, train it on the training dataset, and evaluate its performance on the test dataset.  

## Setup
To run the code in this notebook, you'll need to install the transformers datasets and accelerate libraries:


```
!pip install transformers datasets
!pip install accelerate -U
```

## Data Preprocessing
We preprocess the data by tokenizing the text using the RoBERTa tokenizer, padding and truncating the sequences to a maximum length of 512 tokens.

## Dataset Preparation
We prepare the dataset for the Trainer by creating a custom DepressionDataset class that includes the tokenized encodings and the corresponding labels.

## Model Definition
We define the RoBERTa model for sequence classification using the RobertaForSequenceClassification class with the pre-trained 'roberta-base' model and three output labels.

## Training
We train the model using the Trainer class with the defined training arguments, including the number of training epochs, batch size, and evaluation steps.

## Evaluation
After training, we evaluate the model on the test dataset and print the evaluation results, including the accuracy and a classification report showing precision, recall, and F1-score for each class.

## Example Usage
We provide a function classify_text to classify new social media texts entered by the user. The function tokenizes the input text, makes a prediction using the trained model, and returns the predicted class ("Not depressed," "Moderately depressed," or "Severely depressed").

## Conclusion
The model demonstrates moderate performance in detecting depression from social media posts, with higher accuracy and F1-score for class 1 (moderately depressed) compared to the other classes. Future work could include improving the model's performance with a better dataset and implementing it in social media to monitor and help people.
